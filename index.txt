Jacob (Briar) Hughes

      I am a junior studying computer science.  I hope I can graduate spring of next year.  

      I am a couple of years ahead because I skipped 2 years of highschool.  I went to savannah high and was in marching band both in high school and in college.  

      I plan to get some sort of job in computer science.  Anything from programming to database management to cyber security would make me happy for a job as long as it pays well.
