## About 
I will use this webpage to show off code I write and direct people to worthwhile resources I use

## What it takes to make a repository like mine
### Hardware

1. A computer: I bet you have one if you're on here
1. Wireless mouse: it's  better than trying a trackpad
1. [Headphones](https://www.skullcandy.com/shop/earbuds/jib-with-microphone?optionId=6938 "My Favorite Type"): These are a must have for anyone with a roomate

### Software

1. [GitHub](https://github.com/ "Make yours!") Account: for quick and easy repository access
1. [Git GUI](https://gitforwindows.org/ "To Download"): for pushing files from your machine to the cloud
1. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.6.2.html "Download Here") : an excellent and simple text editor, works great with code
The only language you will need is Markdown

## Handy Links

- [Repl.it](https://repl.it/ "compilers") : an online compile for several languages
- [Stack Ovverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/ "ask and answer") : get help online for syntax and algorythms in common languages
